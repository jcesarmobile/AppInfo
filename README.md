AppInfo
=======

iOS Phonegap Plugin to get app info from the Info.plist

Right now it just returns the app name (CFBundleName), app version (CFBundleShortVersionString) and app build version (CFBundleVersion)

The original idea was to return the full infoDictionary, but one (or more) crash, so I will be adding more of them.

See the index.html for a working example.
